out for me: he was a little more than halfway up but
 still had a lot farther to go.
 I was reminded of times before my son was born,
 when I had silently implored, "Is this all there is? If
 so, then just let me go, God, because I think I've now
 experienced and learned all I possibly can." I was able
 to share with Ben what I have since realized: that these
 periods of boredom, apathy, and even depression mark
 the end of one phase or level of awareness followed by
 periods of intense change and growth, and the intro-
 duction of brand-new creative endeavors. This infor-
 mation seemed to give Ben encouragement, and we
 ended the session with his promise that he would give
 life another chance. Less than a month later he was
 unexpectedly offered a job in Hawaii, and the last I
 heard he was engaged to a wonderful woman he met
 through this new job.
 Obstacles can bump you into
